Two Types of DI :-

1. Setter DI

In Case of Setter DI it is not mandatory to pass value for each and every Property.

2. Using Parameterise Constructor

Dependency Checking
======================

But in Case of Constructor DI it is mandatory to pass value for each and every Constructor parameter.

And to make Setter DI also mandatory we have one concept called dependency checking.

AIM :- To make setter Setter DI also mandatory like Constructor DI.

NOTE :- Support for Dependency Check is deprecated for Spring 4.0
